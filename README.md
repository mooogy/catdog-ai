##  Description

This project is a full-stack image classifier web app that:
- Lets users upload images of cats and dogs
- Uses pretrained ResNet50 embeddings with KNN and Logistic Regression classifiers
- Shows prediction results + a 2D visual of the model's decision space

All models and EDA are built in this **repo**:
[Cat vs Dog Image Analysis â€“ EDA & Model Selection](https://github.com/mooogy/catdog-image-analysis)

## Installation

### Option 1: Using Docker (**Recommended**)

```bash
docker pull mooogy/catdog-ai
docker run -p 8000:8000 mooogy/catdog-ai # launches at http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Local Setup using Python + Make
